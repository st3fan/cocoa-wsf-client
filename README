  http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/

*Example*

The following example makes a call to the SayHello action from the
wsf-examples project.

- (void) demo
{
   NSURL* endointUrl =  [NSURL URLWithString: @"http://localhost:8080/public/api"];

   WSFRequest* request = [WSFRequest requestWithEndpointURL: endpointURL
     version: @"2008-06-27" action: @"SayHello"
     parameters: [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject: @"Stefan" forKey: @"Name"]];

   [[WSFClient clientWithRequest: request delegate: self] retain];
}

- (void) client: (WSFClient*) client didFailWithError: (NSError*) error
{
   NSLog(@"Client %@ failed with error %@", client, error);
}

- (void) client: (WSFClient*) client didReceiveResponse: (WSFResponse*) response
{
   NSLog(@"Client %@ received response %@", client, [response data]);
}

- (void) client: (WSFClient*) client didReceiveErrorResponse: (WSFErrorResponse*) errorResponse;
{
   NSLog(@"Client %@ did receive error response %@", client, errorResponse);
}
